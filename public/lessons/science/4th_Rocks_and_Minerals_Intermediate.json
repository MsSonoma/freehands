  "teachingNotes": "Start with the difference between rocks and minerals - minerals are the building blocks, rocks are made of minerals. Introduce the three types of rocks using simple examples: igneous (granite, obsidian), sedimentary (sandstone, limestone), metamorphic (marble, slate). Demonstrate mineral properties like hardness using the fingernail test and penny test. Show how crystals form in regular patterns. Connect to real-world uses: building materials, jewelry, technology.",
