# Lesson Notes Feature

## Overview

Facilitators can add notes to any lesson in the `facilitator/lessons` page. These notes are:
- Stored per learner in the `lesson_notes` JSONB column
- Automatically included in Mr. Mentor's learner transcript
- Designed to provide context about a learner's specific challenges, progress, or needs

## Database Schema

```sql
-- Column added to learners table
lesson_notes jsonb default '{}'::jsonb

-- Structure: { 'subject/lesson_file': 'note text', ... }
-- Example:
{
  "math/Multiplication_Basics.json": "Struggles with times tables above 5x",
  "science/Solar_System.json": "Very interested in planets, completed ahead of schedule",
  "facilitator/Custom_Lesson.json": "Needs more practice with this concept"
}
```

## UI Features

## Mr. Mentor Integration

### How Notes Appear in Transcript

When a facilitator discusses a learner with Mr. Mentor, notes are included in the transcript:

```
FACILITATOR NOTES ON LESSONS:

math - Multiplication Basics:
  "Struggles with times tables above 5x. Needs more practice with visual aids."

science - Solar System:
  "Very interested in planets, completed ahead of schedule. Asked lots of questions."

language arts - Reading Comprehension:
  "Improving but still needs help with inference questions."
```

### Mr. Mentor's Use
- Notes provide specific context about learner challenges
- Mr. Mentor can reference these in responses
- Enables data-informed, personalized counseling suggestions
- Example response: "I see you noted Emma struggles with times tables above 5x. Have you tried..."

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
const [lessonNotes, setLessonNotes] = useState({}) // { 'subject/lesson': 'text' }
const [editingNote, setEditingNote] = useState(null) // currently editing key
```

### Save Function
```javascript
async function saveNote(lessonKey, noteText) {
  const newNotes = { ...lessonNotes }
  if (noteText && noteText.trim()) {
    newNotes[lessonKey] = noteText.trim()
  } else {
    delete newNotes[lessonKey] // Remove empty notes
  }
  
  await supabase
    .from('learners')
    .update({ lesson_notes: newNotes })
    .eq('id', selectedLearnerId)
}
```

### Transcript Builder
```javascript
// In buildLearnerTranscript()
const lessonNotes = learner.lesson_notes || {};
const notesKeys = Object.keys(lessonNotes).filter(key => lessonNotes[key]);

if (notesKeys.length > 0) {
  lines.push(`FACILITATOR NOTES ON LESSONS:`);
  notesKeys.sort().forEach(key => {
    const [subject, lessonName] = key.split('/');
    lines.push(`${subject} - ${lessonName}:`);
    lines.push(`  "${lessonNotes[key]}"`);
  });
}
```

## Use Cases

Mr. Mentor can suggest:
- Enrichment resources
- Project-based learning ideas
- Real-world applications

### 4. Behavioral Context
**Note:** "Easily distracted. Works better in morning sessions."

Mr. Mentor can suggest:

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Notes
‚úÖ **DO:**

"Visual learner - diagrams help significantly"
"Excellent progress this week, confidence improving"
"Takes longer but produces quality work"
"Asks insightful questions about applications"
```

## Database Migration

To add the column to an existing database:

```sql
-- Run scripts/add-lesson-notes-column.sql
alter table public.learners add column if not exists lesson_notes jsonb default '{}'::jsonb;
create index if not exists idx_learners_lesson_notes on public.learners using gin(lesson_notes);
update public.learners set lesson_notes = '{}'::jsonb where lesson_notes is null;
```
