## Technical Architecture

### API Route: `/api/counselor`
- **Model**: GPT-4o (configurable temperature: 0.8)
- **Max Tokens**: 1500
- **Voice**: en-US-Neural2-D (male, speaking rate 0.88)
- **State**: Stateless API - client sends full conversation history with each request
- **Caching**: TTS responses cached (up to 200 entries)

#### Conversation Flow (Stateless with Full Context)

Each API call is stateless but maintains conversational context:

```
REQUEST (Turn 1):
{
  message: "I'm feeling overwhelmed",
  history: []  // Empty on first message
}

API BUILDS:
[
  {role: 'system', content: MENTOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT},
  {role: 'user', content: "I'm feeling overwhelmed"}
]

RESPONSE (Turn 1):
{
  reply: "I hear you‚Äîthat's normal. What matters most?",
  audio: "base64..."
}

---

REQUEST (Turn 2):
{
  message: "I want them to love learning",
  history: [
    {role: 'user', content: "I'm feeling overwhelmed"},
    {role: 'assistant', content: "I hear you‚Äîthat's normal. What matters most?"}
  ]
}

API BUILDS:
[
  {role: 'system', content: MENTOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT},
  {role: 'user', content: "I'm feeling overwhelmed"},
  {role: 'assistant', content: "I hear you‚Äîthat's normal. What matters most?"},
  {role: 'user', content: "I want them to love learning"}
]

RESPONSE (Turn 2):
{
  reply: "That's a beautiful goal. What does that look like?",
  audio: "base64..."
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Client maintains full conversation history in state
- Each request sends complete prior conversation
- API is stateless‚Äîno server-side session storage
- History grows with each turn, ensuring context continuity

### Learner Context Flow

When a learner is selected from the dropdown:

1. **Client fetches transcript** (`fetchLearnerTranscript`):
   - Queries `learners` table for full profile
   - Calls `getMedalsForLearner` for progress data
   - Builds formatted text transcript via `buildLearnerTranscript`

2. **Transcript included in API request**:
```javascript
{
  message: "How is Emma doing in math?",
  history: [...],
  learner_transcript: "LEARNER PROFILE:\nName: Emma\nGrade: 4\n..."
}
```

3. **API enhances system prompt**:
```javascript
systemPrompt += `

=== CURRENT LEARNER CONTEXT ===
The facilitator has selected a specific learner to discuss...
[Full transcript inserted here]
=== END LEARNER CONTEXT ===

Use this information to provide personalized, data-informed guidance...`
```

4. **Mr. Mentor responds with data-aware insights**:
   - References specific lesson scores
   - Notices patterns (e.g., strong in science, struggling in math)
   - Asks targeted questions about learner's unique situation

**Transcript Contents:**
- Basic profile, targets, timer settings
- Golden keys count
- Approved lessons breakdown by subject
- Medals summary (gold/silver/bronze counts)
- Top 10 lessons per subject with scores
- Limited to 10 lessons/subject to avoid overwhelming GPT context window

**Selection Behavior:**
- "None (general discussion)" ‚Üí `learner_transcript: null` ‚Üí standard counseling
- Learner selected ‚Üí transcript included ‚Üí data-informed counseling
- Transcript regenerates on every message (always current)

## Sample Conversation Flow

### Opening Message (Example)
**User**: "I'm feeling overwhelmed with planning my child's 5th grade curriculum. Where do I even start?"

**Mr. Mentor**: "I hear you‚Äîplanning a full year of curriculum can feel like a mountain to climb. That sense of overwhelm is completely normal, and you're not alone in feeling it. Many parents find that breaking it down into smaller, manageable pieces makes it much less daunting.

Let's start by getting clear on what matters most to you. What are your top priorities for your child's learning this year? Is it building strong foundational skills, fostering curiosity, or something else? And how do you envision your child feeling about learning by the end of the year?"

### Curriculum Planning Request (Example)
**User**: "I need help creating a weekly schedule that balances all subjects."

**Mr. Mentor**: "That's a great goal‚Äîfinding the right balance is key to a sustainable routine. A typical 5th grade week might include daily math and language arts (45-60 min each), alternating science and social studies (3 days each, 45 min), and built-in time for arts, PE, and reading.

But here's what really matters: what does your family's rhythm look like? Are you early morning learners or do you hit your stride mid-day? What subjects does your child naturally gravitate toward, and which ones need more support? When you picture your ideal school week, what does the flow feel like?"

## Testing Scenarios

Test Mr. Mentor with these conversation types:

1. **Frustration Expression**: Parent venting about teaching challenges
2. **Curriculum Planning**: Specific schedule or subject selection questions
3. **Goal Setting**: Long-term educational objectives discussion
4. **Overwhelm**: Multiple concerns expressed at once
5. **Crisis Indicators**: Should trigger redirection to professional help
6. **Learning Difficulties**: Student-specific challenges requiring accommodation

## Best Practices

### For Facilitators Using Mr. Mentor
- Be honest about challenges and feelings
- Provide context about your child's age/grade
- Share specific goals when asking for planning help
- Take notes on insights and action steps
- Export conversations for future reference

### For Development
- Monitor conversation quality via logs
- Refine system prompt based on real usage

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- **PDF Export**: Rich formatting with timestamps
- **Calendar Integration**: Export schedules to Google Calendar/iCal
- **Session Summaries**: AI-generated action items after each conversation
- **Suggested Topics**: Prompt cards for common facilitator concerns
