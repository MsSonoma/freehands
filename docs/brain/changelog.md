2025-12-10T23:55:00Z | Copilot | FIX: Platform Jumper jump button text selection and missed clicks. Jump button caused text highlighting on hold and didn't respond reliably. Added full event handlers (onPointerUp/Leave/Cancel, onContextMenu, onMouseDown, onTouchStart) with preventDefault and stopPropagation to match movement buttons. Added userSelect none to TouchControls wrapper divs to prevent text selection bleed. Files: PlatformJumper.jsx (added missing event handlers to jump button, added userSelect styles to wrapper divs).
2025-12-10T23:45:00Z | Copilot | FIX: Platform Jumper choppy controls - unified input system eliminates competing state updates between keyboard and touch. Touch movement intervals removed, replaced with refs (touchLeft/touchRight) matching keyboard pattern. Game loop now single source for all position updates, checks both keysPressed and touch refs. Shared performJump function prevents duplicate jump logic. Movement and jump now fully parallel - no conflicts during simultaneous input. Files: PlatformJumper.jsx (removed interval refs/functions, added touch refs, consolidated game loop movement logic, created performJump callback, simplified touch handlers to toggle refs).
2025-12-10T23:15:00Z | Copilot | FIX: AI feature toggles in learner settings not respected in session - disabling Ask/Poem/Story/Fill-in-Fun per learner had no effect. Root cause: Session page never loaded or checked learner's ask_disabled, poem_disabled, story_disabled, fill_in_fun_disabled fields from database. Added state variables for each toggle, loaded from learner profile on mount and storage change, conditionally hide disabled feature buttons in both Opening action button groups. askFeatureAllowed now checks both tier entitlement AND learner-specific ask_disabled flag. Files: src/app/session/page.js (added 4 disabled state variables, load from learner on mount + storage change, updated askFeatureAllowed to check askDisabled, wrapped Poem/Story/Fill-in-Fun buttons in conditional render based on disabled flags).
2025-12-10T22:30:00Z | Copilot | Removed stale word avoidance rule - Ms. Sonoma can now naturally say "test", "worksheet", etc.; updated constants.js and brain docs
2025-12-10T01:00:00Z | Copilot | FEATURE: Unified account page with overlay-based settings. Completely restructured /facilitator/account page to consolidate all account management in one place with consistent overlay pattern. Replaced linear sections with 10 clickable heading cards in responsive grid: Your Name, Email and Password, Two-Factor Auth, Facilitator PIN, Connected Accounts, Hotkeys, Timezone, Marketing Emails, Policies, Plan, Danger Zone. Each card opens modal overlay (SettingsOverlay component) with focused settings UI. Created SettingsOverlay.jsx reusable modal component (fixed position, backdrop click to close, Escape key support, body scroll lock, consistent header/body/footer layout). Implemented 10 individual overlay components with full state management and API integration: (1) NameOverlay - display name editing, saves to profiles.full_name + auth metadata, (2) PasswordOverlay - shows email (read-only) + change password link, (3) TwoFactorOverlay - TOTP enrollment with QR code, verify/unenroll, (4) PinOverlay - 4-8 digit PIN + 6 preference checkboxes, /api/facilitator/pin integration, (5) ConnectedAccountsOverlay - Google OAuth link/unlink with ?rts redirect handling, (6) HotkeysOverlay - redirects to /facilitator/hotkeys full page, (7) TimezoneOverlay - dropdown with 10 timezones, /api/profile/timezone, (8) MarketingOverlay - opt-in checkbox, saves to profiles + auth metadata, (9) PoliciesOverlay - links to privacy/terms/data with card layout, (10) PlanOverlay - redirects to /facilitator/account/plan, (11) DangerZoneOverlay - two-step account deletion with /api/user/delete. Redirected old /facilitator/account/settings page to account page (simple redirect component). All settings lazy-load on overlay open (not on page load). OAuth/Stripe redirects properly handled (BFCache for Stripe, ?rts cleanup for Google). Mobile responsive (overlay modals adapt to small screens). All functionality migrated from scattered pages into unified interface. Files: src/components/SettingsOverlay.jsx (NEW - reusable modal), src/app/facilitator/account/page.js (complete restructure - 10 heading cards + 11 overlay components), src/app/facilitator/account/settings/page.js (redirect to account page).
2025-12-10T00:30:00Z | Copilot | FEATURE: Implemented learner selection dropdown for Notes, Schedule, and Assign buttons in lesson editor. All three buttons now show learner selection overlay, load facilitator's learners list, allow selection, then open functional modals with learner context. Notes modal: Textarea for editing lesson notes, loads existing note from learner's lesson_notes, saves to database, updates learner list on save. Schedule modal: Date picker defaulting to today, calls /api/lesson-schedule to schedule lesson for selected learner on chosen date. Assign modal: Toggle lesson availability for selected learner, loads current assignment status from approved_lessons, saves updates to database, shows grant/remove access buttons with status-based styling. All modals show learner name + lesson title, have proper save/cancel actions with loading states. Learner selection dropdown shared across all three actions with context-aware prompt text. Files: src/app/facilitator/lessons/edit/page.js (added learner loading useEffect, showLearnerSelect state, selectedLearnerId/selectedLearner states, learner selection modal, full Notes/Schedule/Assign implementations replacing placeholders).
2025-12-10T00:15:00Z | Copilot | FEATURE: Add Notes, Schedule, Assign, and Delete buttons to lesson editor. Added four action buttons in the LessonEditor header after the Save button: (1) Notes button - shows modal explaining notes require learner context (use main Lessons page). (2) Schedule button - shows modal explaining scheduling requires learner context (use main Lessons page). (3) Assign button - shows modal explaining assignment requires learner list context (use main Lessons page). (4) Delete button - functional delete with confirmation overlay, only works for generated lessons, deletes from Supabase Storage and redirects to lessons page. Notes/Schedule/Assign are placeholders directing users to the main Lessons page where learner context is available. Delete is fully functional for generated lessons with confirmation dialog. Files: src/components/LessonEditor.jsx (added onNotes/onSchedule/onAssign/onDelete props, added four buttons in header), src/app/facilitator/lessons/edit/page.js (added state for modals, added handlers, added four modal overlays with delete implementation).
2025-12-10T00:05:00Z | Copilot | FIX: Beta users blocked from lesson validation auto-fix with 403 error. The /api/facilitator/lessons/request-changes route (used for automatic quality validation fixes after generation) had same issue as generate route - only queried plan_tier and hardcoded check for plan_tier !== 'premium'. When Beta users generated lessons with quality issues, the auto-fix step failed with 403, preventing lesson optimization. Applied same Beta tier resolution pattern: (1) Import resolveEffectiveTier and featuresForTier. (2) Query both subscription_tier and plan_tier. (3) Resolve effective tier (Beta→Plus). (4) Check features.facilitatorTools instead of hardcoded premium. Beta users can now complete full generation flow including automatic quality improvements. Files: src/app/api/facilitator/lessons/request-changes/route.js (import resolveEffectiveTier/featuresForTier line 2, query subscription_tier lines 13-35, resolve tier line 36, check facilitatorTools lines 91-98), src/app/api/lesson-file/route.js (added logging for loaded lesson details).
2025-12-09T23:58:00Z | Copilot | FIX: Edit This Lesson button failing to load generated lessons with "Failed to load lesson" error. Root cause: lesson-maker page stored just the filename (e.g., "3rd_Fractions_intermediate.json") in generatedLessonKey, but lesson editor expects key format "subject/filename". The /api/lesson-file route requires "generated/filename" format to know to load from Supabase storage instead of filesystem. Solution: Changed setGeneratedLessonKey to store "generated/${generatedFile}" instead of just generatedFile. Edit button now correctly navigates to /facilitator/lessons/edit?key=generated/filename and lesson loads successfully. Files: src/app/facilitator/generator/lesson-maker/page.js (line 246-247, prepend "generated/" to filename).
2025-12-09T23:55:00Z | Copilot | FIX: Beta users blocked from generating lessons due to missing tier resolution in generate API. The /api/facilitator/lessons/generate route only queried plan_tier (not subscription_tier) and had hardcoded check for plan_tier !== 'premium', blocking Beta users who have subscription_tier='Beta' but no plan_tier set. Beta users should get Plus-level access including facilitatorTools. Solution: (1) Import resolveEffectiveTier and featuresForTier from entitlements. (2) Query both subscription_tier and plan_tier in readUserAndTier. (3) Call resolveEffectiveTier to map Beta→'plus'. (4) Replace hardcoded premium check with features.facilitatorTools check (available on Plus and above). Beta users now pass facilitatorTools check and can generate lessons. Files: src/app/api/facilitator/lessons/generate/route.js (import resolveEffectiveTier/featuresForTier line 2, query subscription_tier line 17-31, resolve effective tier line 34, check facilitatorTools instead of hardcoded premium line 163-166).
2025-12-09T23:50:00Z | Copilot | FEATURE: Edit This Lesson button in lesson generator appears after successful generation. After lesson is created, "Edit This Lesson" button appears next to "Generate Lesson" button, navigating directly to /facilitator/lessons/edit?key={lessonKey}. Button hidden until generation completes, then stored lesson key enables immediate editing. Provides instant access to edit newly generated lesson without navigating to lessons list first. Files: src/app/facilitator/generator/lesson-maker/page.js (added generatedLessonKey state, set after successful generation, conditional render button with router.push to edit page).
2025-12-09T23:45:00Z | Copilot | FIX: Beta users unable to generate lessons - client-side tier resolution missing. Client components (ClientGenerator, useAccessControl, lessons page, learners pages, calendar) were only querying plan_tier from database, not subscription_tier. This meant Beta users were treated as 'free' tier on client side even though API routes correctly mapped Beta→Plus. Solution: Import resolveEffectiveTier in all client components, query both subscription_tier and plan_tier, call resolveEffectiveTier to get effective tier. Beta users now properly get Plus-level access (5 lifetime + 1 weekly generation, facilitator tools, unlimited lessons). Files: src/app/facilitator/generator/ClientGenerator.jsx (query subscription_tier, use resolveEffectiveTier), src/app/hooks/useAccessControl.js (import resolveEffectiveTier, query subscription_tier, resolve tier), src/app/facilitator/lessons/page.js (import resolveEffectiveTier, query subscription_tier), src/app/facilitator/learners/page.js (import resolveEffectiveTier, query subscription_tier), src/app/facilitator/learners/add/page.js (import resolveEffectiveTier, query subscription_tier), src/app/facilitator/calendar/page.js (import resolveEffectiveTier, query subscription_tier).
2025-12-09T23:30:00Z | Copilot | SECURITY FIX: Generated lessons were leaking across facilitator accounts via metadata API. The /api/lessons/metadata route was searching ALL facilitator folders (facilitator-lessons/*) to find lessons by filename, meaning if two facilitators had lessons with the same filename, they could see each other's lessons. This violated data isolation between facilitators. Solution: Added authentication requirement to metadata API and changed logic to only load generated lessons (subject='generated') from the authenticated user's folder (facilitator-lessons/{userId}/). Public lessons from filesystem remain accessible to all. Files: src/app/api/lessons/metadata/route.js (added auth header parsing, only search authenticated user's folder for generated lessons, skip generated lessons if not authenticated).
2025-12-09T23:00:00Z | Copilot | FEATURE: Beta subscription tier now automatically grants Plus-level access. Users with subscription_tier='Beta' get Plus entitlements (unlimited lessons, facilitator tools, 5 lifetime generations + 1 weekly, 2 learners max) without requiring stripe_subscription_tier or plan_tier to be set. Added resolveEffectiveTier(subscriptionTier, paidTier) helper to entitlements.js that maps Beta→'plus' before lookup. Updated all usage check API routes to query both subscription_tier and paid tier fields, then call resolveEffectiveTier to determine effective access level. Beta remains independent from paid tiers (can change Beta entitlements without affecting Plus subscribers). Files: src/app/lib/entitlements.js (added resolveEffectiveTier function), src/app/api/usage/check-lesson-quota/route.js (query subscription_tier, use resolveEffectiveTier), src/app/api/usage/check-generation-quota/route.js (query subscription_tier, use resolveEffectiveTier), src/app/api/usage/increment-generation/route.js (query subscription_tier, use resolveEffectiveTier), src/app/api/lessons/quota/route.js (import resolveEffectiveTier, query subscription_tier in readPlanTierAndCountInTz).
2025-12-09T22:15:00Z | Copilot | FIX: Learner localStorage persistence across facilitator logout causing "Hi, [wrong learner]!" greeting. When facilitator logs out and different facilitator logs in on same device, /learn page displayed previous facilitator's learner name because learner_id/learner_name/learner_grade/learner_humor_level persisted in localStorage. Logout only cleared Supabase auth tokens, not learner data. Solution: (1) Added comprehensive learner localStorage cleanup to logout handler in account page - clears learner_id, learner_name, learner_grade, learner_humor_level, all pattern-matched keys (learner_humor_level_*, target_comprehension_*, target_exercise_*, target_worksheet_*, target_test_*, atomic_snapshot:*), global target overrides. (2) Added same cleanup to account deletion flow in settings page. (3) Added auth validation to /learn page useEffect - calls getLearner() to verify learner belongs to current facilitator, clears localStorage if not authenticated or ownership fails, prevents stale learner display. Snapshots (atomic_snapshot:*) also cleared to prevent cross-learner session restoration. Files: src/app/facilitator/account/page.js (logout handler lines 452-475, added localStorage cleanup), src/app/facilitator/account/settings/page.js (delete account handler lines 275-300, added localStorage cleanup), src/app/learn/page.js (useEffect lines 1-61, added getLearner import, auth validation with session check, ownership verification, stale data cleanup).
2025-12-09T22:00:00Z | Copilot | FIX: Clear opening action sequences when 30-second countdown starts to prevent hangover at work transition. When play timer expires and countdown overlay appears, any active opening action (ask, joke, riddle, poem, story, fill-in-fun, games) was persisting and could interfere with automatic transition to work subphase (teaching or Q&A) after countdown completes. Solution: Added comprehensive state clearing to handlePlayTimeUp callback - resets all opening action states to 'inactive' (askState, riddleState, poemState, storyState, fillInFunState), hides opening action buttons (setShowOpeningActions(false)), clears story data (transcript, setup step, characters, setting, plot), clears fill-in-fun data (template, collected words, current index), closes games overlay. This ensures clean slate before work phase auto-starts. Files: src/app/session/page.js (lines 813-838 in handlePlayTimeUp), docs/brain/timer-system.md (updated Play Time Expiration Flow section with clearing logic, added Recent Changes entry, updated last_updated timestamp), docs/brain/manifest.json (added 'opening action clearing' to timer-system keywords, updated timestamp).
2025-12-09T21:00:00Z | Copilot | CRITICAL AUTH FIX (ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE): Cross-device logout issue was NOT about localStorage or tabs - it was Supabase signOut() default scope. supabase.auth.signOut() defaults to scope: 'global', which invalidates the session SERVER-SIDE in Supabase database, logging out ALL devices sharing that account. Solution: Changed all signOut() calls to use scope: 'local', which only clears localStorage on current device without invalidating server session. Other devices stay logged in. Reverted unnecessary custom storage adapter and per-user client code from previous attempts. Root cause: Supabase sessions have two layers - client-side localStorage (device-local) + server-side session record (shared). Global scope invalidates shared record, affecting all devices. Local scope only clears device localStorage. Files: src/app/facilitator/account/settings/page.js (added scope: 'local' to delete account signOut), src/app/facilitator/account/page.js (added scope: 'local' to logout button), src/app/lib/supabaseClient.js (reverted to simple singleton client), docs/brain/auth-session-isolation.md (completely rewritten explaining scope issue, when to use local vs global, security trade-offs).

2025-12-09T20:30:00Z | Copilot | CRITICAL AUTH FIX v2: Per-user storage isolation instead of per-tab. Previous fix required re-login on every refresh (unacceptable UX). New approach: each USER gets isolated storage namespace, but same user shares auth across all tabs. Custom storage adapter implements Supabase Storage interface, stores auth at supabase-auth-user-<userId> keys. Client instances cached per userId (not singleton). Same user in multiple tabs shares client and auth (stay logged in together). Different users in different tabs use separate storage keys (isolated). Page refresh auto-detects user ID from localStorage, restores correct client (no re-login). Logout propagates to all tabs for that user but not to tabs with different users. Handles legacy migration from default storage key. Files: src/app/lib/supabaseClient.js (custom UserIsolatedStorage class, clientsByUserId Map, user ID auto-detection), docs/brain/auth-session-isolation.md (completely rewritten with per-user architecture). [REVERTED - see 2025-12-09T21:00:00Z]
2025-12-09T20:00:00Z | Copilot | CRITICAL AUTH FIX: Cross-tab auth leakage - logging out in one tab logged out ALL tabs, logging into new account in Tab A switched Tab B to that account. Root cause: Supabase client used default shared localStorage key 'sb-<project>-auth-token' for all tabs. Auth state changes in one tab immediately affected all other tabs via shared localStorage. Solution: Added per-tab unique storageKey using sessionStorage-persisted UUID (supabase-auth-<UUID>). Each tab generates unique storage key on first load, isolating auth sessions. Tab A logout/login no longer affects Tab B. Auth persists within tab across page navigation but refreshing tab generates new UUID (requires re-login, acceptable trade-off vs auth leakage). Created getTabStorageKey() function, added storageKey config to Supabase client. Created docs/brain/auth-session-isolation.md (per-tab storage keys, sessionStorage UUID, localStorage namespace isolation, migration path, edge cases). Updated manifest.json with auth-session-isolation entry. Files: src/app/lib/supabaseClient.js (added getTabStorageKey function lines 5-17, added storageKey config line 34), docs/brain/auth-session-isolation.md (NEW), docs/brain/manifest.json (added auth-session-isolation entry). [REVERTED - see 2025-12-09T20:30:00Z]
2025-12-09T19:00:00Z | Copilot | Created mr-mentor-session-persistence.md brain file; replaced 8s polling with Supabase realtime subscriptions on mentor_sessions.is_active for instant conflict detection; added atomic gate preventing stale conversation overwrites using last_local_update_at timestamp comparison; implemented turn limits (warn @30, force ClipboardOverlay @50 with disabled Cancel); added last_local_update_at column to mentor_sessions schema; removed duplicate draft_summary storage (single source in conversation_drafts); fixed zombie session cleanup on New Conversation; updated manifest.json with new brain entry
2025-12-09T15:00:00Z | Copilot | FIX: Email confirmation links not working after Supabase signup. Root cause: Missing redirect URL configuration and callback route. Added NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://mssonoma.com to .env.local. Created src/app/auth/callback/route.js to handle email confirmation by exchanging code for session and redirecting to /facilitator. Updated signup/login pages to construct emailRedirectTo as {NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL}/auth/callback. USER MUST: (1) Add NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://mssonoma.com to Vercel environment variables (Project Settings → Environment Variables, apply to all environments). (2) Configure Supabase dashboard to whitelist redirect URL: go to https://app.supabase.com/project/fyfepvozqxgldgfpznrr/auth/url-configuration and add https://mssonoma.com/auth/callback to Redirect URLs list. (3) Redeploy to apply changes. Created docs/AUTH_EMAIL_LINK_FIX.md with setup instructions and troubleshooting. Files: .env.local (added NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL), src/app/auth/callback/route.js (new), src/app/auth/signup/page.js (updated emailRedirectTo), src/app/auth/login/page.js (updated resend emailRedirectTo).
2025-12-09T14:00:00Z | Copilot | FIX: Visual aids broken images due to expired DALL-E URLs being saved to database. Root cause: When download failed, code fell back to original expired URL and saved it. Now implements retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts: 1s, 2s, 4s delays) for both fetch and Supabase upload operations. Retries handle: network timeouts, HTTP 403/404 (expired URLs), HTTP 429 (rate limits), HTTP 5xx errors. Non-retryable errors (400/401, invalid URLs) fail immediately. Images that fail all retries are filtered out (return null) instead of saving expired URLs. Added maxDuration=25 on save route for Vercel timeout protection. Detailed logging tracks attempt numbers, error types, success/failure counts. Updated visual-aids.md brain file with retry logic section and expanded "What NOT To Do" with never-save-expired-URLs rules. Files: src/app/api/visual-aids/lib/downloadImage.js (added retry wrapper, isRetryable, sleep helpers), src/app/api/visual-aids/save/route.js (maxDuration, null filtering, improved logging), docs/brain/visual-aids.md (retry documentation).
2025-12-09T10:00:00Z | Copilot | FIX: Visual aids generation timing out after 30 seconds on Vercel. Root cause: sequential for-loop made 3 API calls per image (prompt generation, description generation, DALL-E), then repeated for count images. With 3 images this meant 9 sequential OpenAI calls taking 40+ seconds. Converted to parallel execution: (1) Generate all images in parallel using Promise.all. (2) Within each image, parallelize description and DALL-E generation after getting prompt. Now all images generate simultaneously, completing well under 30 seconds. Files: src/app/api/visual-aids/generate/route.js (replaced sequential for-loop with generateSingleImage helper + Promise.all).
2025-12-09T07:00:00Z | Copilot | SECURITY FIX: Set explicit search_path on 9 database functions to prevent search path injection attacks. Functions with mutable search_path allow attackers to potentially hijack function behavior by manipulating the schema search order. Added SET search_path to: transcripts_owner_id_from_path, update_visual_aids_updated_at, sync_learners_targets, deactivate_old_mentor_sessions, set_learners_owner_id (includes auth schema), update_lesson_schedule_timestamp, deactivate_old_lesson_sessions, archive_conversation_update, maybe_archive_long_conversation. All SECURITY DEFINER functions now have explicit search_path to prevent privilege escalation. Files: supabase/migrations/20251209010000_fix_function_search_path.sql.
2025-12-09T06:00:00Z | Copilot | SECURITY FIX: Removed SECURITY DEFINER from session_metrics view to enforce RLS. View was running with owner privileges, bypassing Row Level Security and potentially exposing session data across facilitator boundaries. Created migration 20251209000000_fix_session_metrics_security_definer.sql that drops and recreates view without SECURITY DEFINER. View now properly inherits RLS from underlying lesson_sessions table, ensuring facilitators only see their own learner data. Files: supabase/migrations/20251209000000_fix_session_metrics_security_definer.sql.
2025-12-09T00:45:00Z | Copilot | FEATURE: Added TTS prefetch to teaching flow sentence-by-sentence delivery. Teaching phase delivers definitions and examples as multiple sentences (split after GPT call returns full content). Each sentence now prefetches the next one while student reads/processes current sentence. Prefetch triggers added: (1) After first vocab sentence (line 312), prefetch sentence 2. (2) After each subsequent vocab sentence (line 550), prefetch next vocab sentence. (3) After first example sentence (line 436), prefetch sentence 2. (4) After each subsequent example sentence (line 607), prefetch next example sentence. Pattern matches Q&A phases: speak current → prefetch next → gate buttons → student clicks Next → instant playback from cache. Teaching sentences now load instantly after first sentence (2-15 sentences per stage depending on vocab count). Files: src/app/session/hooks/useTeachingFlow.js (import ttsCache line 10, prefetch after sentences lines 312-314, 436-438, 550-552, 607-609). Updated docs/brain/tts-prefetching.md with teaching flow section.
2025-12-09T00:30:00Z | Copilot | FEATURE: Completed TTS prefetch coverage for worksheet and test phases. Added prefetch triggers at lines 6264-6277 (worksheet) and 6383-6391 (test) in page.js. After speaking current question, now prefetch next question OR transition line (worksheet closing "That's all for the worksheet. Now let's begin the test." when last question answered). Worksheet and test now match comprehension/exercise pattern: Q1 instant (awaiting-begin prefetch), Q2+ instant (cache hit from post-answer prefetch). Updated docs/brain/tts-prefetching.md with worksheet/test integration sections showing exact trigger placement. TTS prefetch now complete for all Q&A phases (comprehension, exercise, worksheet, test) - only opening elements and GPT teaching content remain unprefetched.
2025-12-09T00:00:00Z | Copilot | FEATURE: TTS prefetching system to eliminate waiting between questions. Created ttsCache.js module with LRU cache (max 10 items, oldest eviction), AbortController for canceling pending fetches, and prefetch() method for fire-and-forget background loading. Integrated into speakFrontendImpl: checks cache before fetch, stores successful responses. Added prefetch triggers: (1) After speaking comprehension question, prefetch next question from generatedComprehension array. (2) After speaking exercise question, prefetch next question from generatedExercise array. (3) When starting comprehension/exercise phases, prefetch second question while first plays. (4) Cache clears on phase transitions via useEffect to prevent stale audio. Performance impact: Questions 2+ now load instantly (cache hit), eliminating 2-3 second TTS waits that were main app bottleneck. Cache size limited to 10 to prevent memory issues during long sessions. Silent failures on prefetch errors ensure non-critical optimization never breaks core flow. Files: src/app/session/utils/ttsCache.js (new 212-line module), src/app/session/page.js (import line 31, cache check in speakFrontendImpl lines 2927-2962, prefetch after comprehension answer lines 5895-5903, prefetch after exercise answer lines 6063-6071, cache clear effect line 990), src/app/session/hooks/usePhaseHandlers.js (import line 13, prefetch after first comprehension question lines 105-111, prefetch after first exercise question lines 163-169).
2025-12-08T23:15:00Z | Copilot | FIX: Opening actions buttons incorrectly reappearing after Ask Q&A during exercise/comprehension/worksheet/test phases. Root cause: handleAskConfirmYes and handleAskBack in useDiscussionHandlers were calling setShowOpeningActions(true) when in Q&A phases. Opening actions (Ask/Joke/Riddle/Poem/Story/Fill-in-Fun/Games/Go) should ONLY show during entrance state (before Go button is clicked), NEVER during active Q&A phases. The bug caused these buttons to reappear after exiting Ask mode during active Q&A. This is a recurring issue - see changelog entries 2025-12-02T20:00:00Z and 2025-12-02T20:15:00Z for previous attempts to fix related button visibility bugs. Solution: Changed handleAskConfirmYes and handleAskBack to only show opening actions in discussion awaiting-learner phase, explicitly setting showOpeningActions(false) for all Q&A phases regardless of subPhase. Files: src/app/session/hooks/useDiscussionHandlers.js (lines 221-232 and 269-280 removed inQnAPhase logic, now only show buttons in discussion phase).
2025-12-08T22:45:00Z | Copilot | FIX: Snapshot restoration also needs target size validation. Previous fix updated page.js to validate stored arrays match COMPREHENSION_TARGET/EXERCISE_TARGET, but snapshot restoration in useSnapshotPersistence.js still used old length > 0 check. This created race where: (1) Fresh arrays generated with size 5. (2) page.js validation rejected cached size-3 arrays. (3) Fresh size-5 arrays set. (4) THEN snapshot hook restored cached size-3 arrays, overwriting fresh. Flow was: page.js generates correct arrays, then snapshot restoration immediately overwrites them with wrong-size cached arrays. Solution: Pass comprehensionTarget and exerciseTarget parameters to useSnapshotPersistence hook. Changed restoration validation from `length > 0` to `length === comprehensionTarget` and `length === exerciseTarget`. Now cached arrays are only restored if they match CURRENT target sizes. When learner changes targets, cached arrays are invalidated automatically. Files: src/app/session/hooks/useSnapshotPersistence.js (added comprehensionTarget/exerciseTarget params line 84-85, changed validation lines 502-503), src/app/session/page.js (passed COMPREHENSION_TARGET and EXERCISE_TARGET to hook line 3414-3415).
2025-12-08T22:30:00Z | Copilot | FIX: Cached arrays with wrong size restored when learner targets changed. Arrays were generated correctly (size 5 for COMPREHENSION_TARGET=5) but then OLD cached arrays (size 3) were restored from storage, overwriting fresh generation. Console showed: "[ARRAY GEN] Generated arrays - comprehension: 5" then "[handleGoComprehension] generatedComprehension: Array(3) length: 3". Root cause: Validation only checked arrays were non-empty (length > 0), not that they matched CURRENT target sizes. When learner changed from 3 to 5 questions, old 3-question arrays passed validation and got restored. Solution: Changed compOk and exOk validation to require exact size match (length === COMPREHENSION_TARGET and length === EXERCISE_TARGET). Now when targets change, cached arrays are invalidated and fresh arrays generate with correct size. Added diagnostic logging showing target values during generation. Files: src/app/session/page.js (lines 1852-1853 validation, line 1892 logging).
2025-12-08T22:00:00Z | Copilot | FIX: Next question not asked after celebration. After correct answer, Ms. Sonoma said "Good work! That makes 1 correct answer" but didn't ask the next question - just stopped and waited for input. Root cause: Previous fix cleared currentCompProblem and enabled input (setCanSend(true)) expecting user to trigger next question load, but celebration and next question must be spoken in SAME response without user input in between. Solution: After incrementing ticker, immediately load next question from array and speak "Celebration. Progress. Next question" all together in one speakFrontend call. Added nextProblem loading logic after ticker increment in both comprehension and exercise phases. Files: src/app/session/page.js (comprehension and exercise correct answer handling).
2025-12-08T21:30:00Z | Copilot | FIX: Double-increment bug causing Q&A to stop at 2 questions when target=5. Root cause: Pre-picking nextProblem logic incremented currentCompIndex/currentExIndex BEFORE actually asking the question, consuming 2 array slots per question. Flow was: (1) Answer Q1 correctly, pre-pick generatedComprehension[0] as nextProblem, increment index to 1. (2) Speak "Correct! Here's Q2" and ask the pre-picked question. (3) Answer Q2 correctly, pre-pick generatedComprehension[1], increment to 2. (4) But we skipped actually using index 1 - it was consumed during pre-pick! With target=5 and array indices 0-4, after 2 correct answers currentIndex=2 but we only asked questions from slots 0 and 1, burning through array at 2x speed. Solution: Removed all nextProblem pre-picking logic in both comprehension and exercise phases. After correct answer, now clear currentCompProblem/currentExerciseProblem so next question naturally loads from array when handleSend runs again. Each question consumes exactly one array slot. Simplified correct answer flow: celebrate, save snapshot, clear problem, enable input. Files: src/app/session/page.js (removed 50 lines of pre-picking logic, removed defensive array-exhaustion checks which are now impossible).
2025-12-08T20:30:00Z | Copilot | ZOMBIE CLEANUP: Remove final pool references from hooks. Runtime error "ReferenceError: setCompPool is not defined" revealed that zombie pool references still existed in hook parameters and dependencies despite earlier removal of pool state. Removed compPool/exercisePool parameters from useAssessmentDownloads hook definition (line 23-24). Removed compPool/exercisePool from usePhaseHandlers call in page.js (lines 3050, 3053, 3060, 3064). Changed all saveAssessments calls to use empty arrays instead of non-existent pools (useAssessmentDownloads lines 166-167, 212-213, 823-824; page.js line 4738). Removed pool dependencies from all useCallback dependency arrays. All pool references now eliminated from codebase (only explanatory comments remain). Build passes, no more setCompPool errors. Files: src/app/session/hooks/useAssessmentDownloads.js (removed pool params and references), src/app/session/page.js (removed pool params passed to hooks and saveAssessments calls).
