# Short Answer & Fill-in-Blank Backend Judging

**Date**: October 8, 2025  
**Status**: Implemented

## Overview

Extended backend AI judging to both Short Answer (SA) and Fill-in-Blank (FIB) questions across all Q&A phases (Comprehension, Exercise, Worksheet, Test). The backend uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to provide lenient, synonym-aware judging that accepts creative and varied student responses.

## Problem Statement

The original implementation had several issues:
1. SA questions were filtered out and didn't appear in sessions
2. Only local judging was used, which was too strict on exact word matching
3. FIB questions with multiple valid answers would only accept exact matches
4. Creative writing questions required exact wording despite asking for improvement
5. Open-ended "give/name" questions rejected valid synonyms

## Solution

### 1. SA Questions Now Routed to Backend (All Phases)
- Modified `judgeAnswer()` in `src/app/session/page.js`
- All SA questions from `sample` array now tagged with `sourceType: 'short'`
- Removed all SA filters that blocked these questions
- Backend API called for all SA questions with full leniency

### 2. FIB Questions Now Use Backend Judging
- Extended `judgeAnswer()` to also route FIB questions to backend
- Added `isFillInBlank` detection alongside `isShortAnswerItem`
- Backend API now handles FIB with synonym acceptance
- Accepts grammatical variations (singular/plural, tense, articles)

### 3. Enhanced Backend Leniency Types

The `/api/judge-short-answer` endpoint now detects and handles 5 question types:

#### A. Keyword-Based (if keywords provided)
- Requires minimum keyword matches
- Accepts direct synonyms of keywords
- Used when lesson explicitly defines keywords

#### B. Creative Writing Questions
- Detected by: "change", "rewrite", "make descriptive", "improve", "replace"
- Accepts ANY answer that adds descriptive language
- Focuses on improvement, not exact word matching
- Example: "Change 'The dog ran' to be more descriptive"
  - ✅ "the fat, lazy, angry dog sped fast"
  - ✅ "The quick dog hurled itself"
  - ✅ "The small dog sprinted quickly"

#### C. Fill-in-Blank Questions
- Detected by: `___` in question text
- Accepts synonyms that fit the blank correctly
- Accepts singular/plural, tense, article variations
- Example: "A ___ is a hot, dry ecosystem"
  - ✅ "desert"
  - ✅ "deserts"
  - ✅ "arid region"

#### D. Open-Ended Questions (Multiple Acceptable Answers)
- Detected by: "give", "name", "list", "provide", "suggest", "example" + multiple expectedAny
- Accepts ANY one of the expected answers
- Accepts close synonyms or related terms
- Example: "Give an adjective to describe a storm" (acceptable: loud, dark, stormy, wild)
  - ✅ "thunderous" (synonym of loud)
  - ✅ "loud" (exact match)
  - ✅ "booming" (synonym)
  - ✅ "fierce" (related term)

#### E. Default (Exact + Meaning Match)
- Used when no special type detected
- Accepts exact token matches
- Accepts answers that capture the key meaning with different wording

### 4. Base Leniency Rules (All Question Types)
- Lowercase normalization
- Trim whitespace and collapse spaces
- Remove punctuation
- Map number words (zero-twenty) to digits
- Ignore conversational fillers and politeness
- Accept plural/tense changes
- Accept synonyms that convey same meaning

## Files Modified

### `src/app/session/page.js`
- Added `isFillInBlank` import
- Modified `judgeAnswer()` to check both `isSA` and `isFIB`
- Routes both SA and FIB to backend API
- Added console logging for debugging
- Removed SA filters from begin-comprehension and begin-exercise handlers

### `src/app/api/judge-short-answer/route.js`
- Added `isFillInBlank` detection
- Added `isOpenEnded` detection
- Created specialized leniency instructions for each type
- Enhanced base instructions with synonym acceptance

### `src/app/session/utils/assessmentGenerationUtils.js`
- Modified `drawSampleUnique()` to tag items with `sourceType: 'short'`
- Ensures all sample array questions are detected as SA

## Testing

To verify the changes:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Start a session with a language arts lesson (e.g., 4th Creative Writing)
3. Look for console logs:
   ```
   [judgeAnswer] Question type check: { isSA: true, isFIB: false, useBackend: true, ... }
   [judgeAnswer] Sending to backend: { ... }
   [judgeAnswer] Backend response: { correct: true/false, ... }
   ```
4. Test various answer types:
   - Exact match: should pass
   - Synonym: should pass
   - Creative variation: should pass
   - Completely wrong: should fail

## Question Distribution

- SA and FIB questions now both enabled across all subjects
- Capped at 15% each in Worksheet and Test phases
- No filters in Comprehension and Exercise phases
- Questions drawn from:
  - `sample` array (tagged as SA)
  - `shortanswer` array (tagged as SA)
  - `fillintheblank` array (tagged as FIB)
  - Generated comprehension/exercise (pre-tagged)

## Backend API Signature

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/judge-short-answer`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "question": "Give an adjective to describe a storm?",
  "learnerAnswer": "thunderous",
  "expectedAnswer": "loud",
  "expectedAny": ["loud", "dark", "stormy", "wild"],
  "keywords": [],
  "minKeywords": 0
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "correct": true,
  "feedback": "Correct! Good work."
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Less Frustration**: Students no longer penalized for creative or synonym answers
2. **Better Assessment**: Judges understanding, not just exact recall
3. **Lesson Flexibility**: Lesson makers don't need to list every possible synonym
4. **Consistent Judging**: Same leniency across all SA and FIB questions
5. **Scalable**: Easy to add more question types or adjust leniency

## Future Enhancements

- Add explicit synonym dictionaries for common terms
- Allow lesson makers to set leniency level per question
- Track which synonyms students use most often
- Generate suggested `expectedAny` lists based on actual student responses
