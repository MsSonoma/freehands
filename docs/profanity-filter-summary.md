# Profanity Filter Implementation Summary

## Objective
Prevent curse words and inappropriate language from being sent to the Ms. Sonoma AI system, protecting both the AI and maintaining a kid-friendly learning environment.

## Implementation Details

### Files Created
1. **`src/app/session/utils/profanityFilter.js`** - Core filter module
   - Contains profanity word list
   - Provides detection and filtering functions
   - Returns kid-friendly rejection messages

2. **`src/app/session/utils/__tests__/profanityFilter.test.js`** - Test suite
   - Comprehensive unit tests
   - Tests detection, filtering, and edge cases

3. **`docs/profanity-filter.md`** - Feature documentation
   - Complete API reference
   - Usage examples
   - Maintenance guidelines

4. **`docs/profanity-filter-testing.md`** - Manual testing guide
   - Step-by-step test cases
   - Verification procedures

### Files Modified
1. **`src/app/session/page.js`** - Main session file
   - Added import for `checkLearnerInput`
   - Added profanity check at start of `handleSend()` function
   - Added logging for blocked attempts

## How It Works

### Single Point of Entry
All learner text input flows through the `handleSend()` function in `page.js`. By placing the profanity filter at the very beginning of this function, we protect ALL input pathways:

- Discussion phase silly questions
- Ask Questions feature
- Story collaboration
- Poems topic input
- Fill-in-Fun word collection
- Comprehension answers
- Exercise answers
- Worksheet answers
- Test answers

### Filter Logic
```javascript
const profanityCheck = checkLearnerInput(trimmed);
if (!profanityCheck.allowed) {
  console.log('[Session] Profanity detected and blocked:', { filtered: profanityCheck.filtered });
  setLearnerInput("");
  await speakFrontend(profanityCheck.message || "Let's use kind words.");
  return; // STOP - never reaches AI
}
// Continue with normal processing...
```

### Detection Method
- Case-insensitive whole-word matching
- Uses regex patterns for each word in profanity list
- Avoids false positives (e.g., "assessment" is allowed)
- Expandable word list

### User Experience
When profanity is detected:
1. Input field is cleared
2. Kid-friendly rejection message is spoken by Ms. Sonoma
3. User can immediately try again with appropriate language
4. No harsh error messages or disruption to session

### Privacy & Safety
- Blocked text is NEVER sent to AI or backend servers
- Logs use asterisk-censored versions (e.g., "this is ****")
- All filtering happens locally in the browser
- No data retention of blocked attempts

## Testing

### Automated Tests
Run with: `npm test profanityFilter.test.js`

Tests cover:
- ✅ Basic profanity detection
- ✅ Case-insensitivity
- ✅ Whole-word matching
- ✅ Clean text preservation
- ✅ Multiple profanities
- ✅ Empty/invalid input
- ✅ Filtering output

### Manual Testing
Follow the guide in `docs/profanity-filter-testing.md` to verify:
- ✅ Profanity is blocked across all session phases
- ✅ Clean input works normally
- ✅ No API calls made for blocked input
- ✅ Kid-friendly rejection messages
- ✅ No regressions in existing features

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Coverage
- Single entry point ensures nothing slips through
- Protects all session phases and interaction types

### 2. Kid-Friendly
- Gentle, polite rejection messages
- No shaming or harsh feedback
- Maintains positive learning environment

### 3. Privacy-Focused
- Local filtering only
- No transmission of inappropriate content
- Minimal logging with censored output

### 4. Maintainable
- Centralized word list easy to update
- Well-documented code
- Comprehensive test suite

### 5. Performance
- No noticeable delay
- Instant feedback
- Lightweight regex matching

## Profanity List

The filter includes:
- Common profanity (f-word, s-word, etc.)
- Offensive slurs
- Inappropriate sexual terms
- Common variants and misspellings

**Note:** The list is designed to balance protection with avoiding over-blocking of legitimate educational terms.

## Logging

Console output when profanity is blocked:
```
[Session] Profanity detected and blocked: { filtered: 'this is ****' }
```

This helps facilitators monitor without exposing actual inappropriate language in logs.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

1. **Configurable Strictness** - Different levels for different ages/grades
2. **Phonetic Matching** - Detect intentional misspellings (e.g., "fuk")
3. **Context-Aware** - Different rules for different subjects
4. **Admin Dashboard** - View blocked attempts (with privacy protections)
5. **Pattern Detection** - Identify repeated bypass attempts
6. **Multi-Language** - Support for non-English profanity

## Maintenance

### Adding New Words
1. Edit `src/app/session/utils/profanityFilter.js`
2. Add words to `PROFANITY_LIST` array
3. Run tests to verify
4. Consider false positive potential

### Reviewing Effectiveness
- Monitor console logs for patterns
- Gather facilitator feedback
- Update list as needed
- Balance protection with usability

## Dependencies

- No external libraries required
- Uses native JavaScript regex
- Integrates with existing session flow

## Compliance

- Aligns with child safety requirements
- Supports facilitator oversight
- Maintains appropriate learning environment
- Respects privacy while ensuring safety

## Rollout

The feature is:
- ✅ Implemented and ready
- ✅ Tested (automated + manual testing guide provided)
- ✅ Documented (code, API, testing)
- ✅ Non-breaking (adds protection without changing existing flows)
- ✅ Production-ready
