# Short Answer Backend Judging Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented backend judgment for short-answer questions across all Q&A phases (Comprehension, Exercise, Worksheet, Test) while maintaining local front-end judging for TF/MC/FIB questions.

## Changes Made

### 1. New API Endpoint: `/api/judge-short-answer`
**File**: `src/app/api/judge-short-answer/route.js`

- Receives: question, learnerAnswer, expectedAnswer, expectedAny[], keywords[], minKeywords
- Returns: { correct: boolean, feedback?: string }
- Uses OpenAI GPT model with Ms. Sonoma persona
- Applies normalized leniency rules from copilot-instructions.md:
  - Lowercasing, trimming, collapsing spaces
  - Removing punctuation
  - Mapping number words (zero-twenty) to digits
  - Accepting simple plural/tense changes
  - Keyword-based or expected-answer matching
  - Whole-token matching (not substring)
- Low temperature (0.1) for consistent judgement
- Responds with "CORRECT" or "INCORRECT"

### 2. Unified Answer Judging Function
**File**: `src/app/session/page.js`

Added `judgeAnswer(learnerAnswer, acceptable, problem)` helper function that:
- Detects question type using `isShortAnswerItem(problem)`
- Routes to backend API for short-answer questions
- Falls back to local `isAnswerCorrectLocal()` for:
  - True/False questions
  - Multiple Choice questions
  - Fill-in-the-Blank questions
- Includes error handling with automatic fallback to local judging on API failure

### 3. Updated All Q&A Phases

#### Comprehension Phase
- Line ~4618: Changed from `isAnswerCorrectLocal()` to `await judgeAnswer()`
- SA questions now verified by Ms. Sonoma backend
- TF/MC/FIB remain local for speed

#### Exercise Phase
- Line ~4856: Changed from `isAnswerCorrectLocal()` to `await judgeAnswer()`
- Same SA/backend, TF-MC-FIB/local split

#### Worksheet Phase
- Line ~4939: Changed from `isAnswerCorrectLocal()` to `await judgeAnswer()`
- Consistent handling across worksheet items

#### Test Phase
- Line ~5021: Changed from `isAnswerCorrectLocal()` to `await judgeAnswer()`
- No-retry test judging now uses backend for SA

## Key Features

### Seamless Integration
- No UI changes required
- Front-end logic automatically routes to correct judge
- Transparent to learner experience

### Robust Error Handling
- API failures automatically fall back to local judging
- Network errors don't block progress
- Console warnings for debugging

### Consistent Leniency
- Backend uses same normalization rules as copilot-instructions.md
- Keyword matching with configurable minimum
- Accepts direct synonyms and similar phrasing
- Ignores fillers and politeness

### Performance Optimized
- Only SA questions call backend (typically ~10-30% of questions)
- TF/MC/FIB stay instant with local judging
- Async/await doesn't block UI

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Math Lessons**: Test SA word problems with numeric answers
2. **Language Arts**: Test SA questions with keyword lists
3. **Science**: Test SA with expectedAny synonyms
4. **Social Studies**: Test SA with multiple acceptable phrasings

### Expected Behavior
- SA questions take ~1-2s for backend judge (acceptable)
- TF/MC/FIB remain instant
- Failed SA backend calls fall back gracefully
- All hints/reveals still work correctly

## Environment Variables Required
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Must be configured for backend judging
- `OPENAI_MODEL`: Defaults to `gpt-4o-mini` if not set

## Backward Compatibility
- Fully backward compatible
- Existing local judging still works
- No breaking changes to lesson JSON format
- No changes to existing TF/MC/FIB logic

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Cache backend judgements per question+answer pair
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Collect backend judge accuracy metrics
- A/B test backend vs local SA accuracy
