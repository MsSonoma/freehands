# Lesson Management System Pivot - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully pivoted the lesson selection flow from a learner-driven browsing experience to a facilitator-curated approval system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema (`docs/learners-schema.sql`)
- Added `approved_lessons` JSONB column to the `learners` table
- Structure: `{ 'subject/lesson_file': true }` for approved lessons
- Allows facilitators to control which lessons each learner can access

### 2. Learn Page (`src/app/learn/page.js`)
- **Simplified flow**: Now only handles learner selection
- Removed subject and difficulty selection UI
- Auto-navigates to `/learn/lessons` after learner selection
- Stores learner info in localStorage (id, name, grade)

### 3. Lessons Page (`src/app/learn/lessons\page.js`)
- **Complete rewrite** to show only approved lessons
- Fetches approved lessons from `learners.approved_lessons` for current learner
- Groups lessons by subject with subject labels on each card
- Displays all approved lessons together (no folder navigation)
- Shows helpful message when no lessons are approved yet
- Maintains medals, quota tracking, and loading states

### 4. Facilitator Hub (`src/app/facilitator/page.js`)
- Added "Lessons" button to main navigation
- Positioned between "Learners" and "Plan"

### 5. Facilitator Lessons Management (`src/app/facilitator/lessons/page.js`)
- **New page** for managing lesson approvals
- Dropdown at top to select which learner to manage
- Lists ALL lessons from ALL subjects
- Organized by subject headings (Math, Science, Language Arts, Social Studies, Facilitator Lessons)
- Checkbox for each lesson labeled "List" to approve/unapprove
- Real-time updates saved directly to database via Supabase
- Premium feature gated (requires `facilitatorTools` entitlement)

## User Flow

### Learner Flow
1. Visit `/learn`
2. Select a learner (or auto-selected if already set)
3. Automatically redirected to `/learn/lessons`
4. See only lessons approved by facilitator, grouped by subject
5. Click "Begin" to start a lesson

### Facilitator Flow
1. Visit `/facilitator`
2. Click "Lessons"
3. Select a learner from dropdown
4. Browse all available lessons organized by subject
5. Check boxes next to lessons to approve them for that learner
6. Changes save automatically
7. Facilitator-created lessons appear here too (not on Learn page until approved)

## Technical Details

### Data Storage
- Approved lessons stored in `learners.approved_lessons` as JSONB
- Format: `{ "math/lesson_file_name": true, "science/another_lesson": true }`
- Direct Supabase updates from client (RLS protects data)

### Facilitator Lessons
- Custom lessons created via Lesson Maker tool
- Stored in "Facilitator Lessons" folder
- Show up in facilitator/lessons page automatically
- Only appear on learner's page after checkbox approval

### Migration Notes
- Database migration required: Run the updated `learners-schema.sql`
- Existing learners will have `approved_lessons = null` initially
- Facilitators need to approve lessons for each learner
- No breaking changes to existing lesson data or session code

## Benefits
1. **Better control**: Facilitators curate age-appropriate content
2. **Simpler UX**: Learners see only what's relevant to them
3. **Flexible**: Different lesson sets per learner
4. **Unified view**: All approved lessons in one place, not scattered by subject
5. **Clear attribution**: Each lesson shows its subject on the card

## Files Modified
- `docs/learners-schema.sql`
- `src/app/learn/page.js`
- `src/app/learn/lessons/page.js`
- `src/app/facilitator/page.js`

## Files Created
- `src/app/facilitator/lessons/page.js`

## Next Steps for Deployment
1. Apply database migration to add `approved_lessons` column
2. Deploy updated code
3. Notify facilitators to approve lessons for their learners
4. Optional: Create bulk approval tool if needed for large lesson sets
