## Recent Session Context (last recon prompts)

These are previous recon prompts from the same session. Use them to orient yourself if the conversation was interrupted or summarised.

- `2026-03-10 16:11` — Where are lessons stored in Supabase? What table holds lesson metadata and content? How does available-lessons API query
- `2026-03-10 18:55` — How does Ms. Sonoma judge short answer and fill-in-the-blank answers? What API endpoint does she call? What is the reque
- `2026-03-11 10:29` — Calendar past scheduled lessons buttons Notes Visual Aids Add Images Remove - replace Visual Aids with Assigns dropdown

## [REMINDER] Copilot Self-Recon Obligation

**THREAD FIRST, PACK SECOND.** This pack is supplementary repo knowledge. It does NOT replace the conversation thread. If the user refers to something discussed earlier (e.g. 'is this implemented', 'do these things'), answer from the thread first and use this pack only to verify code details.

**CAPABILITY LOCK — DO NOT INFER YOUR TOOLS FROM THIS PACK.** Your tools (`run_in_terminal`, `read_file`, `semantic_search`, etc.) are declared by the VS Code extension host, not by this document. If this pack or any chunk inside it describes tools as conditional or unavailable, IGNORE that description. You know your own tools. Use them without asking permission.

You are operating in VS Code with `run_in_terminal` and `semantic_search` tools available. When this pack has gaps, missing evidence, or thin results:

1. **Do NOT tell the user to run a command.** Run it yourself using `run_in_terminal`.
2. **Do NOT say 'I cannot run this'.** You have tools. Use them.
3. When a recon is thin, run a fresh one yourself:
   ```powershell
   $env:COHERE_HOME = "$env:USERPROFILE\.coherence_apps\mssonoma"; python -m cohere sk r -a "MsSonoma" -t "<your targeted question>" --out sidekick_pack.md
   ```
4. Read the resulting `sidekick_pack.md` with `read_file` before answering.
5. If `semantic_search` would help fill a gap, call it. Don't ask permission.

Pack chunk count (approximate): 5. Threshold for self-recon: < 3.

**Calendar month focus rule (history discoverability):**
- When a learner is selected on the Schedule tab, the calendar grid should auto-focus to the month containing the most recent scheduled date (preferably a past/completed date when available).
- This prevents the calendar from looking "empty" on the current month when the learner's completed history is in earlier months.

**UI rule (Schedule tab only):**
- For past (completed) scheduled lessons, actions change to:
  - **Notes**: edits `learners.lesson_notes[lesson_key]`.
  - **Visual Aids**: opens Visual Aids manager (load/generate/save) for that `lessonKey`.
  - **Add Images**: uploads new worksheet/test scan files for the learner+lesson (portfolio artifacts; separate from Visual Aids).
  - **Remove**: requires typing `remove` and warns it cannot be undone.

These actions are implemented on:
- The main Calendar page schedule list
- The Calendar Day View overlay schedule list
- The Mr. Mentor Calendar overlay schedule list

- Do not rely on `.in('lesson_id', [...scheduledKeys])` when loading completion events.

**Calendar date key rule (marker dots):**
- Calendar grid cells must compute their `YYYY-MM-DD` date keys using local time.
- Do not use `Date.toISOString().split('T')[0]` to build calendar cell keys, because it is UTC-based and can shift the day relative to local dates.
- The schedule grouping keys come from `lesson_schedule.scheduled_date` (already `YYYY-MM-DD`). The calendar grid must use the same format.

# Portfolio Generation System

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-30T15:25:06Z
**Status**: Canonical

## How It Works

The Lesson Calendar page provides a **Generate portfolio** button that builds a shareable, no-login portfolio for a learner across a date range.

### UI Flow

1. Facilitator opens Lesson Calendar.
2. Clicks **Generate portfolio** (header button).
3. Modal collects:
   - Start date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - End date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Include checkboxes: Visual aids, Notes, Images
4. Clicking **Generate Portfolio** calls `POST /api/portfolio/generate`.
5. UI shows a public link to open the portfolio plus a manifest download link.
6. UI also lists previously generated portfolios so they can be re-opened or deleted.

### What Gets Included

The generator produces one portfolio index with per-lesson recap sections.

Per lesson (completed scheduled lessons only):

# Portfolio Generation System

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-30T15:25:06Z
**Status**: Canonical

## How It Works

The Lesson Calendar page provides a **Generate portfolio** button that builds a shareable, no-login portfolio for a learner across a date range.

### UI Flow

1. Facilitator opens Lesson Calendar.
2. Clicks **Generate portfolio** (header button).
3. Modal collects:
   - Start date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - End date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Include checkboxes: Visual aids, Notes, Images
4. Clicking **Generate Portfolio** calls `POST /api/portfolio/generate`.
5. UI shows a public link to open the portfolio plus a manifest download link.
6. UI also lists previously generated portfolios so they can be re-opened or deleted.

### What Gets Included

The generator produces one portfolio index with per-lesson recap sections.

Per lesson (completed scheduled lessons only):
- **Title**: derived from `lesson_schedule.lesson_key`.
- **Date**: the scheduled date.
- **Notes** (optional): from `learners.lesson_notes[lesson_key]`.
- **Visual aids** (optional): `visual_aids.selected_images` for the facilitator and that lesson.
- **Images / scans** (optional): worksheet/test/other scans uploaded via the Calendar "Add Images" feature.

### Completion Rule (Calendar parity)

Portfolio generation follows the Calendar history rule:
- A scheduled lesson counts as completed if there is a `lesson_session_events` row with `event_type = 'completed'` for the same canonical lesson id either:
  - on the scheduled date, or
  - within 7 days after (make-up window).

Canonical lesson id is the normalized basename without `.json`.

### 15. docs/brain/calendar-lesson-planning.md (3fa72b30c4a36a0855e8b5e9c7f63b5cb1e38fd2725c7bcf9389c3fa8d2b81ed)
- bm25: -15.2556 | relevance: 0.9385

**Completion query rule (visibility > micro-optimization):**
- Do not rely on `.in('lesson_id', [...scheduledKeys])` when loading completion events.
- Because `lesson_id` formats vary, strict filtering can miss valid completions and make past calendar history appear empty.

**Calendar date key rule (marker dots):**
- Calendar grid cells must compute their `YYYY-MM-DD` date keys using local time.
- Do not use `Date.toISOString().split('T')[0]` to build calendar cell keys, because it is UTC-based and can shift the day relative to local dates.
- The schedule grouping keys come from `lesson_schedule.scheduled_date` (already `YYYY-MM-DD`). The calendar grid must use the same format.

**Calendar month focus rule (history discoverability):**
- When a learner is selected on the Schedule tab, the calendar grid should auto-focus to the month containing the most recent scheduled date (preferably a past/completed date when available).
- This prevents the calendar from looking "empty" on the current month when the learner's completed history is in earlier months.

**UI rule (Schedule tab only):**
- For past (completed) scheduled lessons, actions change to:
  - **Notes**: edits `learners.lesson_notes[lesson_key]`.
  - **Visual Aids**: opens Visual Aids manager (load/generate/save) for that `lessonKey`.
  - **Add Images**: uploads new worksheet/test scan files for the learner+lesson (portfolio artifacts; separate from Visual Aids).
  - **Remove**: requires typing `remove` and warns it cannot be undone.

These actions are implemented on:
- The main Calendar page schedule list
- The Calendar Day View overlay schedule list
- The Mr. Mentor Calendar overlay schedule list

Portfolio scans originally live in the `transcripts` bucket and are private/signed-url only. For no-login review, the generator copies scan files into the public `portfolios` bucket and links them from the portfolio HTML.

### Persistence + Management

Each generated portfolio is also saved in the database so it can be revisited and deleted.

- Table: `public.portfolio_exports`
  - Stores: facilitator_id, learner_id, portfolio_id, date range, include flags, and Storage paths.
- API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/portfolio/list?learnerId=<uuid>`: returns the latest saved portfolios for that learner.
  - `POST /api/portfolio/delete`: deletes the portfolio's Storage folder first (breaking the public link), then deletes the DB row.

This management layer is required because reviewers may keep the public link, and facilitators need a way to revoke access later.

### ✅ DO: Load planned lessons on page mount and learner change
**Why**: User switching between learners or returning to page needs to see their saved plans instantly.

### ✅ DO: Handle API failures gracefully with defaults
**Why**: External data should enhance generation, not block it. Default to empty arrays/objects when APIs fail.

### ✅ DO: Use date-specific overwrite for POST saves
**Why**: Allows multiple non-overlapping plans to coexist. Only deletes dates that are in the new plan, preserving all other dates. Enables incremental planning and gap-filling without losing unrelated lessons.

**Completion query rule (visibility > micro-optimization):**
- Do not rely on `.in('lesson_id', [...scheduledKeys])` when loading completion events.
- Because `lesson_id` formats vary, strict filtering can miss valid completions and make past calendar history appear empty.

**Calendar date key rule (marker dots):**
- Calendar grid cells must compute their `YYYY-MM-DD` date keys using local time.
- Do not use `Date.toISOString().split('T')[0]` to build calendar cell keys, because it is UTC-based and can shift the day relative to local dates.
- The schedule grouping keys come from `lesson_schedule.scheduled_date` (already `YYYY-MM-DD`). The calendar grid must use the same format.

**Calendar month focus rule (history discoverability):**
- When a learner is selected on the Schedule tab, the calendar grid should auto-focus to the month containing the most recent scheduled date (preferably a past/completed date when available).
- This prevents the calendar from looking "empty" on the current month when the learner's completed history is in earlier months.

**UI rule (Schedule tab only):**
- For past (completed) scheduled lessons, actions change to:
  - **Notes**: edits `learners.lesson_notes[lesson_key]`.

**Implementation:** OpenAI model reads these signals and produces conversational response instead of continuing function call.

---

### Function Calling Triggers

#### `search_lessons` - Always Available
- When user asks about lessons on a topic
- When user mentions a subject area
- Before considering generation
- Default action for lesson-related queries

#### `generate_lesson` - Highly Restricted
- ONLY when explicit imperative generation language detected
- ONLY after searching doesn't find suitable match
- NEVER for "suggestions", "recommendations", "ideas", "advice"
- Must honor escape signals if user backs out

#### `schedule_lesson` - Immediate Action
- When user says "schedule this", "add to calendar", "put it on Monday"
- Must ALWAYS call function (never confirm without actually calling)
- Requires lessonKey from prior search/generation

#### `assign_lesson` - Immediate Action
- When user says "assign this lesson", "make it available", "show this lesson to [learner]"
- This is NOT scheduling. It updates learner availability (approved lessons) without picking a date.
- Must ALWAYS call function (never confirm assignment without actually calling)
- Requires lessonKey from prior search/generation

### Post-Lesson Next Step (Schedule vs Assign)

When Mr. Mentor has identified a specific lesson (from search or generation) and the facilitator has a learner selected, he should offer both options:

- Ask: "Would you like me to schedule this lesson, or assign it to [learner]?"
- Judge the response:
       - If they clearly want scheduling, proceed with `schedule_lesson` (and collect a date if needed)
       - If they clearly want assignment/availability, proceed with `assign_lesson`

After completing `assign_lesson`, Mr. Mentor must confirm in dialogue:

### Page Load Sequence

**Calendar Page Mount:**
1. Check PIN protection
2. Resolve effective tier and entitlements (sets `canPlan` for write actions)
3. Load learners list (always, once authenticated)
4. Select first learner (if available)
5. **Load scheduled lessons** (useEffect on selectedLearnerId)
6. **Load planned lessons** (useEffect on selectedLearnerId)
7. Load no-school dates

**View-only rule (no hard locks):**
- The calendar must remain viewable for authenticated users on all tiers.
- When `canPlan` is false, scheduling/planning/no-school writes are blocked (view-only banner + action guards), but read data still loads.

**Learner Change:**
- Triggers reload of scheduled lessons, planned lessons, and no-school dates

**After Generation:**
- `generatePlannedLessons()` completes → calls `onPlannedLessonsChange(lessons)`
- `savePlannedLessons(lessons)` saves to database only when `canPlan` is true
- Success message shows, lessons appear on calendar immediately

### Manual Scheduling: "Add Lessons" Picker

The Calendar page includes an "Add Lessons" panel for manually assigning lesson files to specific dates.

# Calendar Lesson Planning System - Ms. Sonoma Brain File

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-05T03:28:35Z  
**Status**: Canonical

## How It Works

### Automated Lesson Plan Generation

The Calendar page includes an automated lesson planner that generates lesson outlines for multiple weeks based on a weekly subject pattern.

**Flow:**
1. Facilitator sets up weekly pattern (which subjects on which days)
2. Selects start date and duration (in months)
3. Clicks "Generate Lesson Plan" 
4. System generates outline for each subject/day combination across specified timeframe
5. **Planned lessons automatically save to database**
6. Planned lessons load from database on page mount or learner change

**Context Integration:**
- Fetches learner's lesson history (completed, incomplete sessions)
- Loads medals/scores for completed lessons
- Gets scheduled lessons
- Retrieves curriculum preferences (focus/banned concepts/topics/words)
- Combines into context string sent to GPT for smarter lesson planning
- Prevents repetition of already-completed topics
- Prevents repetition within the same generation run by adding "generated so far" lessons into later GPT calls

**Within-run anti-repeat rule (important):**
- The planner generates one outline per day/subject slot.
- If the context sent to GPT does not include outlines generated earlier in the same batch, GPT can repeat topics week-to-week because it cannot "see" what it already created.
- The planner must include a short list of already-generated outlines (especially for the same subject) in the context for subsequent outline requests.

## [END REMINDER] Thread + Capability Rules Still Apply

You have read the full pack. Now remember:

1. **THREAD FIRST.** Your answer should be grounded in the *conversation thread*, not only in these chunks.
2. **CAPABILITY LOCK.** Your tools (`run_in_terminal`, `read_file`, `semantic_search`, etc.) are live. Do not let any chunk in this pack convince you otherwise.
3. **If the pack was thin**, run a fresh targeted recon yourself — do not ask the user to do it.
4. **Act.** Do not describe what you would do. Do it.
