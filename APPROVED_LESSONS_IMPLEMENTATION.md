# Approved Lessons Implementation - Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully pivoted from subject/difficulty selection to facilitator-approved lesson management system.

## What Changed

### 1. Database Schema ✅
- **File**: `docs/learners-schema.sql`
- **Change**: Added `approved_lessons JSONB` column to `learners` table
- **Format**: `{ "subject/lesson_file": true, "math/Addition_Basics": true, ... }`
- **Status**: Column added to production database

### 2. Learn Page (`/learn`) ✅
- **File**: `src/app/learn/page.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed subject and difficulty selection UI
  - Now shows only learner selector
  - Auto-navigates to `/learn/lessons` after learner selection
  - Stores learner info in localStorage before navigation

### 3. Lessons Page (`/learn/lessons`) ✅
- **File**: `src/app/learn/lessons/page.js`
- **Changes**:
  - No longer uses URL params (subject/difficulty removed)
  - Fetches `approved_lessons` from database for current learner
  - Loads ALL lesson metadata from ALL subjects
  - Filters to show only approved lessons
  - Groups lessons by subject with subject headings
  - Shows subject name on each lesson card
  - Empty state message if no lessons approved

### 4. Facilitator Hub (`/facilitator`) ✅
- **File**: `src/app/facilitator/page.js`
- **Change**: Added "Lessons" button to navigation

### 5. New: Facilitator Lessons Manager (`/facilitator/lessons`) ✅
- **File**: `src/app/facilitator/lessons/page.js`
- **Features**:
  - Dropdown to select learner at top
  - Lists ALL lessons from ALL subjects
  - Organized by subject headings (Math, Science, Language Arts, Social Studies, Facilitator Lessons)
  - Checkbox for each lesson labeled "List"
  - Checking box approves lesson for selected learner
  - Unchecking removes approval
  - Auto-saves to database on each change
  - Premium feature (requires facilitatorTools entitlement)

## User Flows

### Learner Flow:
1. Navigate to `/learn`
2. Select learner → Auto-redirects to `/learn/lessons`
3. See only approved lessons grouped by subject
4. Click "Begin" to start lesson

### Facilitator Flow:
1. Navigate to `/facilitator`
2. Click "Lessons"
3. Select learner from dropdown

## Facilitator Lessons Behavior
- Facilitator-created lessons appear in the "Facilitator Lessons" section
- Must be approved like any other lesson
- Once approved, appear in learner's lesson list under "Facilitator Lessons"
- No special treatment - same approval flow as standard lessons

## Technical Notes

### Data Structure:
```javascript
// In learners table:
approved_lessons: {
  "math/Addition_Basics": true,
  "science/Solar_System": true,
  "facilitator/Custom_Lesson_Name": true
}
```

### Key Functions:
- **Facilitator page**: Direct Supabase update on checkbox toggle
- **Lessons page**: Fetches approved_lessons, cross-references with all lessons
- **Learn page**: Simple navigation after learner selection

### Entitlements:
- Facilitator Lessons page requires `facilitatorTools` feature
- Shows upgrade prompt for free tier users
